## About me

Github: [the-c0d3r](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/)
LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/thuyeintun/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thuyeintun/)


Welcome to my digital garden. This is where I publish my [[03-Resource/knowledge/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] notes.

The purpose of this site is to share my notes with the world and build in public. There might be links that seems dead, but those are my currently private notes that I am not publishing just yet, for a variety of reasons, maybe it is unpolished, maybe it contains sensitive data, etc. 

In general I have notes for like
- software development
- #hacking 
- #linux 

My interests
- [[02-Area/programming/Linux\|Linux]]
- [[02-Area/hacking/Hacking\|Hacking]]
- [[02-Area/programming/Programming\|Programming]]
- [[03-Resource/knowledge/Knowledge\|Knowledge]]

## Projects
- my own obsidian plugin [[Garden/posts/Linked Note Exporter\|Linked Note Exporter]] 🚀
- my [dotfiles](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/dot-files) : recently I have been heavily into [[10-Inbox/Nix\|Nix]] to declaratively manage my packages, and dotfiles.

## knowledge-base
This is where I will be putting notes that might be incomplete, atomic and unpolished.

## posts
This is where I will be putting longer form posts that are more polished.
