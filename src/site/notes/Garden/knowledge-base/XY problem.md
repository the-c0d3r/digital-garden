# XY problem

topics: [[Garden/posts/Problem Solving\|Problem Solving]]
tags: #evergreen


The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. This leads to enormous amounts of wasted time and energy, both on the part of people asking for help, and on the part of those providing help.

## What to do about it?

- Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.
- If someone asks for more information, do provide details.
- If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.

Remember that if your diagnostic theories were accurate, you wouldn't be asking for help right?
