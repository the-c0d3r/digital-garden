# The fear of starting

There is a certain risk exposed to people who have a very lively inner world.

Whenever those people are faced with a certain possibility, a certain change, they can't help but to imagine.
That imagination is perfected into something that you very much want. Even though people said that you should visualise your dream.

However, what they fail to take into account is that those people aforementioned, will visualise it to perfection. And as such, they are scared to make them into a reality. There is a voice in your head, saying what happens even if you try to bring about that change and it is not as perfect as you imagined?

It's okay to not know everything about a field before starting. Knowing something is better than not knowing anything about the field.

This is distilled from the article [If It Doesn’t Suck, It’s Not Worth Doing](https://medium.com/the-mission/if-it-doesnt-suck-it-s-not-worth-doing-1efdc6eb695c)
