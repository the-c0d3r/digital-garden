## When you want to save time

- Use it as automation tool
- if you already know how to write it, and want to skip the boilerplate, then use LLM.
- if you don't know how to approach or solve a problem, ask LLM to [[03-Resource/knowledge/Divide and conquer\|Divide and conquer]] into steps for you
- if you don't know but it is trivial to pick up then you can use LLM to automate
    - such as like generating [[10-Inbox/streamlit\|streamlit]] code for your application

## When you want to learn new things

- ask for it how to start learning about a topic
    - what are the keywords you should know about

## Note

- AI will never volunteer to optimise code
- they can only do what you ask of it, and sometimes will outright do things you specifically asked not to.
- you need a proper guidelines for AI to follow such as
	- create unit tests
	- refactor code into different files
	- simplify the code, especially after changing some stuff, they won't refactor even though it's obvious to us
- can't think of solution for you
- can't make proper judgement calls
- AI have a serious [[Garden/knowledge-base/XY problem\|XY problem]].
    - it will only help you try to solve problem, but never stopping to ask why you need to solve it in the first place.

## Recommended Prompt for AI chatbots

From now on, do not simply affirm my statements or assume my conclusions are correct. Your goal is to be an intellectual sparring partner, not just an agreeable assistant. Every time I present an idea, do the following:
1. Analyze my assumptions. What am I taking for granted that might not be true?
2. Provide counterpoints. What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?
3. Test my reasoning. Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws or gaps I haven’t considered?
4. Offer alternative perspectives. How else might this idea be framed, interpreted, or challenged?
5. Prioritize truth over agreement. If I am wrong or my logic is weak, I need to know. Correct me clearly and explain why.”

Maintain a constructive, but rigorous, approach. Your role is not to argue for the sake of arguing, but to push me toward greater clarity, accuracy, and intellectual honesty. If I ever start slipping into confirmation bias or unchecked assumptions, call it out directly. Let’s refine not just our conclusions, but how we arrive at them.
