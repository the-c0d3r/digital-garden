# Write in public

Why write in public?

Because writing in public
- forces me to write down [[03-Resource/knowledge/Tacit Knowledge\|Tacit Knowledge]] and share with the world
- makes me care about the writing quality, because now it is no longer just for my consumption/understanding
- can avoid repeating the same thing to different people who I mentor
    - e.g. [[Garden/posts/Notes for Newbie Developers\|Notes for Newbie Developers]], [[Garden/posts/Note taking for software development\|Note taking for software development]]
    - [[01-Project/systems/System - keeping up-to-date\|System - keeping up-to-date]], [[01-Project/systems/System - knowledge generation\|System - knowledge generation]], [[10-Inbox/Systems for thinking\|Systems for thinking]]
