# Problem Solving


When solving problems, we have tendency to think about _What can we add to make things better?_ rather than _What can be removed to make things better?_

This is especially evident in engineering problems. So think about this when considering problem solving.

First step of problem solving is to identify the problem itself. 
Talk to the other party, sit down and identify the problem. Treat it as you both are trying to solve the problem identified. And make sure the other party knows, it's not me against you, it's we against the problem.

## Debugging

- Assume you did something wrong. *This is true for 99% of the cases*
- Based on that assumption, work backwards on where are the possible areas that can go wrong.
- write down hypothesis, check if they are valid hypothesis

## Data modeling

Before you start even coding a single line, look at the data, study it. 
Get intimate with it.
