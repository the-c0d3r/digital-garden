# Linked Note Exporter
tags: #obsidian 

This is an obsidian plugin that I created, for the purpose of exporting the notes together with related (linked) notes and files. 

Github Link: [the-c0d3r/obsidian-linked-note-exporter: Obsidian plugin to export a note along with all its attachments and linked notes—cleanly, conveniently, and ready to share.](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/obsidian-linked-note-exporter)

## What it does
- Exports complete packages: Copies your note and every image or file embedded in it.
- Follows your thoughts: Can optionally grab the notes you linked to (and the notes they link to!).
- Canvas Friendly: Fully supports Obsidian Canvas files.
- Smart Organization: Keeps your files tidy, either matching your vault or organizing by your document's headers.
- Ready to Share: Can zip everything up automatically.
- Flexible: Works with both `[[WikiLinks]]` and standard `[Markdown Links](path.md)`.
