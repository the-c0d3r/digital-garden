# So what ?

related: [[02-Area/web-clippings/First, Make Me Care\|First, Make Me Care]]

This is a question that is quite effective at cutting fluff, extracting out the important bits, suitable for many occasions.
e.g. in presentations, in tracking [[02-Area/work/files/Work Accomplishments\|Work Accomplishments]], in software development, in client interactions, etc.

**Software development**
This is a question you should be asking yourself when you talk about your impact.

I made a nice UI. So what? Anyone can make a UI. What does your UI help make possible?
I made a data processing engine. So what?
You catch the drift.
