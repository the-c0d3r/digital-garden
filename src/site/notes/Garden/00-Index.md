# Index

Welcome to my digital garden

In general I have notes for like
- software development
- #hacking 
- #linux 


## Projects
- my own obsidian plugin [[Garden/posts/Linked Note Exporter\|Linked Note Exporter]] 🚀
- my [dotfiles](https://github.com/the-c0d3r/dot-files) : recently I have been heavily into [[10-Inbox/Nix\|Nix]] to declaratively manage my packages, and dotfiles.

## knowledge-base
This is where I will be putting notes that might be incomplete, atomic and unpolished.

## posts
This is where I will be putting longer form posts that are more polished.
